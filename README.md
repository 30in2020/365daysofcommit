# 365 Days of Commit

> Code anywhere, Commit everyday. My personal coding challenge for 2020.

**Day 0: December 31, 2019** 

2020 is just starting tomorrow. I'm having mixed feelings about it. This is the year I will be in my 30s and at the same time my salary will be frozen due to company circumstances. Well...so I decided to make some slight changes in my life. I will **commit** and **push** code to my github repository, and **write** what I did at here **every single day** in this year. The code will be mainly related to my interests or my personal projects, and I will try not to bring the code at work here. All kinds of feedback like comments and PR are always welcome, and please point out if there is a grammar error, since English is not my native language. This project is highly inspired by the daily coding project called **[100-days-of-code](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code)**.
