# 365 Days of Commit

> Code anywhere, Commit everyday. My personal coding challenge for 2020.

**Day 0: December 31, 2019**

2020 is just starting tomorrow. I'm having mixed feelings about it. This is the year I will be in my 30s and at the same time my salary will be frozen due to company circumstances. Well...so I decided to make some slight changes in my life. I will **commit** and **push** code to my github repository, and **write** what I did at here **every single day** in this year. The code will be mainly related to my interests or my personal projects, and I will try not to bring the code at work here. All kinds of feedback like comments and PR are always welcome, and please point out if there is a grammar error, since English is not my native language. This project is highly inspired by the daily coding project called **[100-days-of-code](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code)**.

### Day 1: January 1, 2020 (Wed)

**Today's Focus (keyword)**: Learn and code [SWR](https://swr.now.sh/).

> Tag: `SWR`, `React`, `Typescript`

**Details**:

- Recently I heard a lot about a stack called [SWR](https://swr.now.sh/), a React Hooks library for remote data fetching. It has a lot of feature that I want, such as caching, revalidation, and local mutation for optimistic UI. (looks similar to Apollo...) So I decided to learn it.
- Today, I tried to read the document and write basic data fetching and global configuration code.
- I made a repo called [doodles](https://github.com/30in2020/doodles). All the code from my personal study will be uploaded here.
