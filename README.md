# 365 Days of Commit

> Code anywhere, Commit everyday. My personal coding challenge for 2020.

**Day 0: December 31, 2019**

2020 is just starting tomorrow. I'm having mixed feelings about it. This is the year I will be in my 30s and at the same time my salary will be frozen due to company circumstances. Well...so I decided to make some slight changes in my life. I will **commit** and **push** code to my github repository, and **write** what I did at here **every single day** in this year. The code will be mainly related to my interests or my personal projects, and I will try not to bring the code at work here. All kinds of feedback like comments and PR are always welcome, and please point out if there is a grammar error, since English is not my native language. This project is highly inspired by the daily coding project called **[100-days-of-code](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code)**.

### Day 1: January 1, 2020 (Wed)

**Today's Focus**: Learn and code [SWR](https://swr.now.sh/).

**Details**:

- Recently I heard a lot about a stack called [SWR](https://swr.now.sh/), a React Hooks library for remote data fetching. It has a lot of feature that I want, such as caching, revalidation, and local mutation for optimistic UI. (looks similar to Apollo...) So I decided to learn it.
- Today, I tried to read the document and write basic data fetching and global configuration code.
- I made a repo called [doodles](https://github.com/30in2020/doodles). All the code from my personal study will be uploaded here.

### Day 2: January 2, 2020 (Thu)

**Today's Focus**: Continue learning [SWR](https://swr.now.sh/) library.

**Details**:

- Tried to use React.Suspense mode with [SWR](https://swr.now.sh/). By just passing `suspense: true` to useSWR's option parameter, it enabled me to use the mode.
- Also tried data fetching using GraphQL. Used [GraphQLZero](https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/) for implementing fake APIs.

### Day 3: January 3, 2020 (Fri)

**Today's Focus**: Learn how to make WebGL glitch effect with scroll interaction. Search a shader sample to use.

**Details**:

[![monokai_tokyo](./assets/Jan-03-2020_monokai_tokyo.gif "Monokai: a trip through Japan")](https://monokai.nl/2019/japan/)

> [Monokai: A trip through Japan](https://monokai.nl/2019/japan/)

- I found a cool project called 'A trip through Japan'. I love the way it uses shader effects for the character animation on background. I don't know the specific name of shaders, but it seems like using glitch and noise shader...just my assumption.
- Checked with the inspector and realized that the letters in front ('Tokyo' and caption) and behind (kanji) are separated into different layers. The former is DOM, and the latter is canvas using WebGL.
- With reference to this artwork, I'm going to make a similar one. (Instead, I wanted to make it using React as a precondition.) I searched the shader samples and found a good one I was looking for: [GlitchFilter](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-filters/tree/master/filters/glitch) of [Pixi.js](https://www.pixijs.com/). I need to modify the original code to use it on react environment. I will do it tomorrow...
- By the way, today there was a first pull request from this account. ðŸŽ‰

### Day 4: January 4, 2020 (Sat)

**Today's Focus**: Find a React renderer modules for three.js.

**Details**:

- There was a lot of three.js module using React, such as `react-three`, `react-three-renderer`, and `react-three-fiber`. I chose [`react-three-fiber`](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber) because it works fine in React v16, and it comes with a lot of hooks already.

### Day 5: January 5, 2020 (Sun)

**Today's Focus**: Add `useScrollPosition` hook.

**Details**:

- Added `useScrollPosition` hook, referring to [this article](https://dev.to/n8tb1t/tracking-scroll-position-with-react-hooks-3bbj). I learned some facts about Hooks which I didn't usually know, such as the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`, and when to use `useRef` instead of `useState`.
  - `useEffect`Â runsÂ asynchronouslyÂ and after a render is painted to the screen. That goes:
    1. You cause a render somehow (change state, or the parent re-renders)
    2. React renders your component (calls it)
    3. The screen is visually updated
    4. THENÂ useEffectÂ runs
  - `useLayoutEffect` runsÂ synchronouslyÂ after a render but before the screen is updated. That goes:
    1. You cause a render somehow (change state, or the parent re-renders)
    2. React renders your component (calls it)
    3. useLayoutEffectÂ runs, and React waits for it to finish.
    4. The screen is visually updated
  - According toÂ React HooksÂ reference guide,Â `useRef`Â is useful for more than the ref attribute. Itâ€™s handy for keeping any mutable value around similar to how youâ€™d use instance fields in classes. If you want to use a stateful value that won't triggerÂ re-renderÂ on each state change, use `useRef`.
- Refactored the `GlitchFilter` code to make it usable with React context.

### Day 6: January 6, 2020 (Mon)

**Today's Focus**: Learn how to use `react-three-fiber` with shaders.

**Details**:

- It seems that `react-three-fiber` makes me deal with three.js code 'more React way'. Thanks to `extend` function, I could write the shader code in JSX like I was coding a normal react component. Also, it seems that I can pass uniform parameter by just giving prop data to shader components. Needs more research...

### Day 7: January 7, 2020 (Tue)

**Today's Focus**: Learn `MethodChannel` of `Flutter` by reading official documents.

**Details**:

- Learned about the fundamentals of `MethodChannel` of `Flutter`. `MethodChannel` makes it possible to communicate between Flutter and native code.
- The implementation of `MethodChannel` varies depending on the package. According to official documents, in case of `Android`, implementing MethodChannel logic inside the `configureFlutterEngine()` is recommended. Some of the documents were out of sync with the latest version, so I fixed it and sent PR.

### Day 8: January 8, 2020 (Wed)

**Today's Focus**: Learn how to change(and animate) shader values of post-processing filters using `react-three-fiber`.

**Details**:

![glitch_scroll_20200108](./assets/Jan-08-2020_glitch_with_scroll_sync.gif "GlitchPass, HalftonePass, FilmPass with react-three-fiber")

> Animated GIF showing the sample I made today.

- Few days ago, I tried to modify the [GlitchFilter](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-filters/tree/master/filters/glitch) code to use this filter in React environment, but I decided to try it after studying more. I don't think I can do it right now because I'm stuck in the basics. Instead, I used `GlitchPass` (and also `FilmPass`, `HalftonePass`) that were built in Three.js.
- Learned how to change shader's uniform value when using `react-three-fiber`. Pass the value to `uniform-${uniform_variable_name}-value` prop of Pass components, like this:
  ```html
  <effectComposer ref="{composer}" args="{[gl]}">
    <renderPass attachArray="passes" scene="{scene}" camera="{camera}" />
    <glitchPass attachArray="passes" x renderToScreen />
    <halftonePass
      attachArray="passes"
      uniforms-blending-value="{1}"
      renderToScreen
    />
    <filmPass
      uniforms-grayscale-value="{0}"
      attachArray="passes"
      renderToScreen
    />
  </effectComposer>
  ```

### Day 9: January 9, 2020 (Thu)

**Today's Focus**: Add `react-dat-gui` to make it possible to control shader parameters by using `dat.GUI`.

**Details**:

- To control shader parameters by GUI, I tried `react-dat-gui` library, the React version of `dat.GUI`. (`dat.GUI` is commonly used in the Three.js project.)
- First I installed this module using npm. However, the released version on npm did not contain the index.d.ts file, causing a complie error. Be cafeful!

### Day 10: January 10, 2020 (Fri)

**Today's Focus**: Make it possible to control GlitchPass by using dat.GUI. (not finished yet...)

**Details**:

- Added the uniform values of `GlitchPass` to `dat.GUI`. Unfortunately, because I've deleted all the random values in `GlitchPass.render`, the effect animation looks like broken. Need to fix it tomorrow...
- Also, I learned how to get a flutter app to communicate with webview in both directions. It uses `webview_flutter` and `JavascriptChannel`. I will upload the code about this in a few days.

### Day 12: January 12, 2020 (Sun)

**Today's Focus**: Write some sample codes of Github GraphQL API v4

**Details**:

- Finally I managed to get right data using Github GraphQL API v4. I wrote some sample codes, such as fetching pinned repositories, the information of repositories, commit history, and PR list.
- It seems there is no API for getting files' patch history in API v4. If I want to get modified file list, I think I should use the previous version.

**Today's Focus**: Using Github GraphQL API v4, REST API v3, and `diff2html` library

**Details**:

- Using GraphQL API v4, now I can fetch the ratio of languages used in one repository. It has two interger parameter called `totalSize` and `size`, so I can calculate the ratio of languages by using these values. Also, I used REST API v3 for getting a patch string of single commit.
- I wanted to show the patch/diff string beautifully, so I decided to use `diff2html` library but because of some unexpected errors, it didn't worked well. I'll fix this tomorrow...

### Day 14: January 14, 2020 (Tue)

**Today's Focus**: Learn how to use `diff2html` and show modified file list.

**Details**:

- Kept thinking about how to get the diff string of single commit. Finally I found the [`document about media type`](https://developer.github.com/v3/media/#diff). I could get the diff string by setting media type to `application/vnd.github.v3.diff`.
- Now I think the next mission is how to apply different color scheme to the code for each language.
